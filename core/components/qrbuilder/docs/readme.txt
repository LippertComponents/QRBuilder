QRBuilder is a CMP for MODX Revolution. It allows users to easily build customer QR codes in the MODX Manager. 
These QR Codes have simple counter stats within the MODX Manager. It also allows builds into the URL parameters 
for Analytics, like Google, Piwik or similar. It will build a short URL like http://mysite.com/qr*123 that would 
redirect to the destination like http://mysite.com/folder/page.html?analytics_params=123&param2=abc&etc. This will allow the 
QR Codes to be less complex so they will have better compatibility with QR scanners on smaller prints.
